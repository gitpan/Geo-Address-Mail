NAME
    Geo::Address::Mail - A Mailing Address on Earth

SYNOPSIS
    Geo::Address::Mail provides a generic object representation of a mailing
    address that may be subclassed to provide more specific typing of
    attributes. The core class, Geo::Address::Mail provides common, loosely
    typed attributes and methods.

        use Geo::Address::Mail::US;

        my $add = Geo::Address::Mail::US->new(
            name => 'Cory G Watson',
            street => '123 Main St',
            city => 'Testville',
            postal_code => '12345'
        );

SUBCLASSING
    The real reason for Geo::Address::Mail is to provide a common class that
    can be used to build mailing address objects for other countries.

    Subclasses are expected additional type refinement and attributes. For
    example, Geo::Address::Mail::US uses a more specific type for validation
    USPS ZIP codes and adds a "street2" attribute for an optional additional
    line of addressing.

ADDITIONAL USES
    Using a common address object enables a family of distributions that
    provide interesting address functionality such as
    Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer.
